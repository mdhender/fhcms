## Floats vs Integers

Precision limitations on integer values
1. Integers from −253 to 253 (−9,007,199,254,740,992 to 9,007,199,254,740,992) can be exactly represented
2. Integers between 253 and 254 = 18,014,398,509,481,984 round to a multiple of 2 (even number)
3. Integers between 254 and 255 = 36,028,797,018,963,968 round to a multiple of 4
